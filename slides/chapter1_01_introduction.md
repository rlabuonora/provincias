# The economy of Argentina

With almost 40 million inhabitants and a diverse geography that encompasses the Andes mountains, glacial lakes, and the Pampas grasslands, Argentina is the second largest country (by area) and has one of the largest economies in South America. It is politically organized as a federation of 23 provinces and an autonomous city, Buenos Aires.

We will analyze ten economic and social indicators collected for each province. Because these indicators are highly correlated, we will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce redundancies and highlight patterns that are not apparent in the raw data. After visualizing the patterns, we will use k-means clustering to partition the provinces into groups with similar development levels.

# Print something
print("Hello world", quote = FALSE)

```out
Hello world
```
